# Java-Asm7
The objective of this task is to enhance your proficiency in implementing coding logic that involves sequencing and selection. This exercise will provide you with an opportunity to develop your skills in structuring program flow to execute tasks in a specific order and make decisions based on certain conditions.

 
Task:

Write a simple guessing game.

    Create a secret number using the Math.random() function to randomly select numbers between 1 and 5.
    To generate a number in the range 1 <= number <= 5, you would use this: 

Math.floor(Math.random() * 5) + 1

    Give the user 1 chance to guess.
    Let them know whether they've guessed correctly, either way (if they guessed correctly, say so; if not, say so and let them know what the secret number was). 
    The input and output should be via prompt() and alert()
